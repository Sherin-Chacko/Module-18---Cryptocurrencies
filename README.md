# Module-18---Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies


### Purpose:
A client asked for a list of tradable cryptocurrencies and wants to be able to pick them from a classification system.

a) To Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
b) Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
c) Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
d) Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.

### Results:

## The list of tradable cryptocurrencies after cleaning:

## K-means Clustering Algorithm, Elbow Curve:

## Applying the Principal Component Analysis:

## 3D Scatterplot with Clusters, Visualizing Tradable Cryptocurrencies:
